# (1). SW parameters for germanene, used by LAMMPS, derived from VFF model analytically.

# these entries are in LAMMPS "metal" units:
#   epsilon = eV; sigma = Angstroms
#   other quantities are unitless

# format of a single entry (one or more lines):
#   element 1, element 2, element 3, 
#   epsilon, sigma, a, lambda, gamma, costheta0, A, B, p, q, tol
